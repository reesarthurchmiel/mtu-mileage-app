#Background on Mobile Testing Unit (MTU) Mileage App

This web app was created to track mileage payments at work. Essentially, we were paid £0.45 per mile
from the company's base, which was in Southampton, to whichever location we were running a COVID-19 test site that day. We had to submit a record of our locations at the end of the month. Out of curiosity, I decided to track how many miles I was driving from my home and how it compared to my compensation.
